<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Occupancy Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PIR (passive infrared) Sensors</li><li>Ultrasonic Sensors</li><li>Dual-technology Occupancy Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The occupancy sensor market is primarily categorized into three types: PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and dual-technology sensors. PIR sensors detect infrared radiation from occupants' body heat, making them effective in static environments. Ultrasonic sensors emit sound waves and gauge changes in their reflections, providing greater detection range and sensitivity, especially in dynamic spaces. Dual-technology sensors combine both PIR and ultrasonic technologies, enhancing accuracy by minimizing false triggers and maximizing detection capabilities, particularly in areas with complex layouts or significant movement.</p></p>
