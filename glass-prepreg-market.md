<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Prepreg Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting</li><li>Thermoplastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Glass Prepreg market is divided into Thermosetting and Thermoplastic types. Thermosetting prepregs use resins that irreversibly cure when heated, offering high strength, durability, and heat resistance, making them ideal for aerospace and automotive applications. Thermoplastic prepregs, on the other hand, use resins that soften when heated and harden upon cooling, allowing for recyclability, faster processing, and impact resistance, suitable for industries requiring lightweight and reusable materials. Both types leverage glass fibers for reinforcement, catering to diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
