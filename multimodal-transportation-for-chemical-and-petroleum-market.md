<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multimodal Transportation for Chemical and Petroleum Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vessel Operating MTOs (VO-MTOs)</li><li>Non-Vessel Operating MTOs (NVO-MTOs)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multimodal transportation in the chemical and petroleum markets involves the coordinated movement of goods across various transport modes. Vessel Operating MTOs (VO-MTOs) own and operate vessels, providing integrated shipping services directly, often catering to bulk chemicals and petroleum products. In contrast, Non-Vessel Operating MTOs (NVO-MTOs) do not own vessels; instead, they manage logistics and act as intermediaries, arranging the transport of chemicals and petroleum through third-party carriers. Both play crucial roles in efficiently managing complex supply chains.</p></p>
