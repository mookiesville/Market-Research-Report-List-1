<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Controlled-release Fertilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulphur-coated urea (SCU)</li><li>Polymer-coated products</li><li>Polymer/ Sulphur-coated products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The controlled-release fertilizers market mainly includes three types: Sulphur-coated urea (SCU), polymer-coated products, and polymer/sulphur-coated products. SCU is urea coated with sulfur that gradually releases nutrients over time, improving nitrogen use efficiency. Polymer-coated products utilize a polymer layer to provide a sustained nutrient release, enhancing plant uptake while minimizing leaching. Polymer/sulphur-coated products combine these two methods, offering a synergistic effect that optimizes nutrient delivery, ensuring plants receive essential nutrients when needed for better growth and yield.</p></p>
