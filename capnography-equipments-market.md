<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capnography Equipments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mainstream Capnographys</li><li>Sidestream Capnographys</li><li>Microstream Capnographys</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The capnography equipment market comprises three main types: mainstream, sidestream, and microstream capnometers. Mainstream capnographs measure carbon dioxide (CO2) directly in-line with the airway, offering real-time monitoring. Sidestream capnographs sample gas from the airway through a tube, providing versatility but potentially slower response times. Microstream capnometers utilize a more compact and efficient design, allowing for low-flow sampling and reduced dead space, making them ideal for various clinical settings. Each type serves distinct applications in patient monitoring and anesthesia.</p></p>
